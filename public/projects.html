                        <p class="card-text">It was our first week of Bootcamp. I still remember sitting down and
                            feeling anxious and excited. The first few days were hard it seemed at the time. I had
                            thoughts of 'What's a div again'? Don't panic but WARNING! DON'T GO INTO VIM!! The terminal
                            navigation came with practice! Do you feel lost? GIT STATUS!! or CD start from the
                            beginning. Then the CSS came in and that was so
                            technical you almost
                            wanted to walk away at that point thinking 'Is it always going to be this technical'? The
                            answer is Yes, but it get easier and fun!! The week
                            ended and we gave in to the facts from Q that we have no life through May, but would be
                            worth it. At the time I didn't believe him but in the coming weeks I became a believer, but
                            I've loved the journey and what was hard this week is now easy today. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Oh vanilla JavaScript you definitely made us all want to throw our computer
                            away, and yell excited when it worked hours later! The most difficult
                            assignment I made more then it needed to be, but wrapping my head around the syntax and
                            function capability made all of us stare at Q with blank faces. Side Note shoutout to Q,
                            Riley (TA), and Isaac (TA) what a fun and SO HELPFUL bunch!! The most rewarding was
                            learning my window.onload function and scope. Those easy fixes make it nice if you know what
                            they
                            are, but keep working at it that moment when 'IT WORKS' is awesome. Did I mention I
                            literally drive 2 hours
                            to go to
                            class and home 3 days a week, ' I can do hard things' is all I thought driving home! Now my
                            divs, columns, and rows are better! I can position down
                            to the pixels and know what I am doing with CSS. I love the UI in frontend so this came fun
                            to me! I know what your thinking 'I knew it wasn't that hard'. Trust me it's hard, but break
                            it down one element at a time. You will start to remember more each time, or GOOGLE it!

                        <p class="card-text">We are officially 8 weeks in. HTML is coming easy, JS is getting better but
                            it's just a drop in the bucket, but HEY HELLO JQUERY! Jquery made JS so much better. Way to
                            grab those elementsById and plug in what was passed to the function. Methods are in full
                            fource and nothing like a little append(), addClass(), or onclick() functions to make life
                            easier! There's the scope again, columns and rows to fit our map, populating by zipcode in
                            search input, and doing a reverse geolocation with our AJAX call. The biggest struggle was
                            definitely learning to be a TEAM, pushing to GitHub, MERGING, and then do a pull request! We
                            may have slacked each other code
                            when it was messy, master was behind or ahead, but we got through it!</p>

                            My biggest struggle was accomodating to the CSS and
                            Boostrap within my JQUERY classes. I ended up reaching out to a tutor now and dedicating
                            that time to ask the questions I need to "get it". I really have to reference on the
                            JS with the syntax and punctuation. Just one semi colon can break it or punctuation in a
                            getElementById("ID name goes here"). This assignment
                            was built on JavaScript and that is about it! It was difficult to manuever the classes and
                            update the CSS with that and
                            Boostrap, but I got it functioning and just had to let this one go! I luckily got a good
                            grade and learned from it, but remember I mentioned my UI Frontend LOVE? I felt I slacked a
                            bit on this one, but I got my local storage. I learned with local storage you have to get
                            and and
                            set your item. This enables you to get it into local storage, store it, and display it. This
                            storage is only local to the UI's computer you wouldn't want to use this for any real
                            storing like data or passwords.

                            this time, yay! Our eyes and thoughts with this one got to be more then we had time for. We
                            had to really bring it down to a few functions get that working and let it be. Our one
                            hurdle was the CSS again and the tags changing multiple html pages. Our main purpose with
                            this project was to add and update our Users perscription needs and schedules. We were able
                            to add and update perscriptions. Our expectations of adding notifications got the short end
                            of the stick with this one. Over all it was a good experience learning and setting every
                            person a certain part of the code. We now have added many folders and pages like public
                            folders, databases in MYSQL, schemas, and routes. We are officially bringing it to the front
                            and the back. Full stack just became a thing! Did I say divs were hard on week one? </p>
